below the median and one-half above the median. Median earnings is restricted to individuals 16 
years old and over with earnings and is computed on the basis of a standard distribution. (See the 
“Standard Distributions” section under “Derived Measures.”) Median earnings figures are calculated 
using linear interpolation. (For more information on medians and interpolation, see “Derived Measures.”)
